        <h2>Information About Your Right to Object under Art. 21 GDPR</h2>
        <h3>Right to Object in Individual Cases</h3>
        <p>You have the right, for reasons arising from your particular situation, to object at any time to the
            processing
            of your personal data based on Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR (data processing based on balancing of interests);
            this
            also applies to profiling based on this provision in accordance with Art. 4 No. 4 GDPR.</p>
        <p>If you object, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate
            grounds for processing that outweigh your interests, rights, and freedoms, or if the processing serves the
            establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.</p>
